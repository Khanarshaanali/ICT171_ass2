## Overview
This project hosts a basic HTML website on an AWS EC2 instance with Apache and a custom domain name secured using an SSL certificate.

### Development Timeline

- **Week 1:**  
  Registered an AWS account and launched an Ubuntu instance on EC2. Familiarized myself with the AWS Management Console and basic cloud infrastructure basics.

- **Week 2:**  
  Assigned an Elastic IP to the EC2 instance to ensure a fixed public IP address. Established a secure SSH connection to the Ubuntu server. Installed and configured Apache web server, successfully bringing the server online.

- **Week 3:**  
  Moified a free public HTML template from HTML5up.net and customized the content and styling to fit my project requirements. Deployed the modified website to the Apache server and tested functionality to ensure proper loading and responsiveness.

- **Week 4:**  
  Purchased a custom domain from Namecheap.com and configured DNS settings to point to the Elastic IP of my server. Set up an SSL certificate to enable HTTPS, ensuring secure and trusted connections for visitors. Finalized deployment and performed end-to-end testing.
